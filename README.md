Data files and assorted code used in Lattimer &amp; Cranmer 2024, "A Self-Consistent Treatment of the Line-Driving Radiation Force for Active Galactic Nuclei Outflows: New Prescriptions for Simulations."  Requires QSOSED (https://github.com/arnauqb/qsosed) to be installed. 

Note: the python version of QSOSED is no longer maintained by the author (see the Julia version for the most current version); the code provided here requires replacing the sed.py file in QSOSED's pyagn folder with the modified sed.py file provided here.
